# Levenshtein-Distance-Finder
Program that finds the Levenshtein Distance between two words of the same length.
Openning LevenDistanceFinderMain.java, it will ask the user for two words.
The user will input a starting and an ending word of the same length.
The program will find the Levenshtein Distance between the two words,
and return the word path and Levenshtein Distance between the two words.

an error message will occur.
